# Risks of Using Weft

Like all DeFi protocols, Weft comes with a set of risks that users should consider before depositing significant assets.mPlease note that this list is not exhaustive, and new risks may emerge over time.

## Protocol-Related Risks

These risks are directly tied to Weft’s internal operations and smart contract functionality:

Smart Contract Risk: There is always a possibility that the Weft smart contracts could be exploited, leading to the theft or permanent freezing of funds. While smart contract risks can never be fully eliminated, they can be mitigated through careful design, security audits, and best practices.

Oracle Risk: Weft uses an internal price feed because there is no suitable Oracle Network available on the Radix network at present. Although an Aggregate Multi-Source Strategy is employed to avoid dependency on a single source, there is still a risk that multiple sources could report incorrect prices simultaneously, causing wrongful liquidations.

Slashing or Staking Risk: Since Weft allows the use of staked assets or liquid staking derivatives as collateral, there is a risk of slashing (penalties imposed on validators) or staking-related losses. These events could reduce the value of collateral and compromise the security of loans.

Cross-Protocol Risk: Weft may integrate or interact with other DeFi platforms or protocols, and vulnerabilities in those external protocols could impact Weft, resulting in potential losses or disruptions.

## Base Layer 1-Related Risks

These risks are associated with the Radix decentralized ledger, the underlying Layer 1 network that Weft operates on:

Wallet Provider Risk: Weft supports all Radix-compatible wallets, including Radix Wallet and Zeus Wallet. If a vulnerability is discovered in any of these wallets, Weft users’ assets could be affected.

## Other Risks
These risks apply broadly to the DeFi space and digital assets, impacting Weft in ways similar to other protocols:

Regulatory Risk: The regulatory status of Weft, $WEFT, and distributed ledger technology remains uncertain in many jurisdictions. Digital assets are increasingly targeted by regulators worldwide, and it is difficult to predict how or when regulations might be applied to Weft. Regulatory changes could negatively impact Weft’s operations, and the protocol may be forced to cease operations in certain regions due to legal or commercial reasons.

Risk of Insufficient Information: Weft is still under development, and its design, algorithms, and technical details are constantly evolving. While efforts are made to provide the most up-to-date information, the Weft Project Contributors may not be able to disclose all progress or updates, leading to inevitable information gaps.

Competitive Risk: The DeFi space is growing rapidly, and new networks or applications may emerge that use similar protocols or code as Weft. Weft may face competition from these alternatives, potentially negatively impacting its market position and $WEFT’s value.

Risk of Failure to Develop: There is a possibility that Weft’s development may not proceed as planned due to factors such as market conditions, technical difficulties, or funding shortages. This could result in the project not being fully executed or implemented.

Liquidity Risk: There may be times when liquidity for certain assets or markets within Weft declines, making it difficult for users to withdraw or liquidate positions. Low liquidity could also lead to slippage or delays, particularly in volatile market conditions.

Key Management Risk: Users are responsible for managing their private keys. If private keys are lost, forgotten, or stolen, the corresponding funds on Weft may be permanently lost. Additionally, using insecure methods for storing private keys could expose users to hacking or phishing attacks.

Market Risk: The digital asset market is inherently volatile, and significant fluctuations in asset prices could impact collateral values or loaned assets on Weft. Sharp market movements could trigger unexpected liquidation events or make it difficult for borrowers to repay loans.
