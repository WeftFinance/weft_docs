## Lending and Borrowing

**What are Lending Pools?**  
Lending Pools allow users to deposit assets and earn interest while borrowers can access these assets by providing collateral.

**How does borrowing work on Weft?**  
Borrowers must deposit collateral to borrow assets. The amount they can borrow is determined by the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio associated with their collateral.

## Collateral Management

**What types of collateral pools are available?**  
Weft offers three types of collateral pools:
1. Asset Collateral Pools: No interest earned.
2. Deposit Unit Collateral Pools: Earn interest while leveraging assets.
3. Liquid Stacking Unit Collateral Pools: Use listed Validator LSU as collateral while earning network emissions.

**What is a "Wefty"?**  
A "Wefty" is an NFT that houses usersâ€™ collateral and loan positions, ensuring secure operations related to CDPs.

## Liquidation Process

**What is liquidation in the context of Weft?**  
Liquidation occurs when a CDP's collateral value no longer covers its loan. If this happens, liquidators can repay part of the debt in exchange for the collateral, which includes a liquidation bonus.

**How is the health factor of a CDP calculated?**  
The health factor is calculated as the total loan value divided by the sum of all collateral values multiplied by their respective liquidation thresholds. A health factor greater than 1 indicates risk of liquidation.

## Additional Features

**What are flash loans?**  
Flash loans allow users to borrow assets without upfront collateral, provided they return the borrowed amount within the same transaction.

**What is the purpose of price feeds in Weft?**  
Price feeds provide real-time asset prices essential for determining borrowing power and evaluating resources in lending and collateral pools.
