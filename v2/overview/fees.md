# Fees

To maintain the sustainability of the protocol, Weft charges transaction fees for certain operations. Please note that not all fees are fixed, and some may have a 0% rate. Refer to the protocol configuration for specific details.

## CDP Creation Fee

A fixed fee is charged each time a Weft CDP (Collateralized Debt Position) is created. This acts as a Sybil resistance mechanism.

## Borrowing Fee

When users take out a loan, a portion of the borrowed amount is collected by the protocol as income.


## Borrowing Interest Fee

When users repay loan interest, a percentage of the total interest is allocated to the protocol as income.


## Liquidation Fee

If a user's CDP becomes unhealthy and is liquidated, a percentage of the liquidation bonus is collected by the protocol as income. When an NFT used as collateral is liquidated, liquidation fees is based on underlying asset Liquidation fees value and paid to the protocol in XRD.


## Flash Loan Fee

For flash loans, a small percentage of the loan amount is collected by the protocol as income.
