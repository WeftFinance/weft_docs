## August 2023: Validator Node <Badge type="info">Completed</Badge>

In late August, we initiate our journey by **launching our Validator Node** on the Radix Public Ledger. As outlined by our [**tokenomics**](/token#token-circulation-strategy), we will distribute **20% of WEFT tokens** to our Validator node stakers. The **validator fee rate** will vary from **100% to 1%** according to the following schedule:

- **100% staking fees for the first 6 months after the validator node launch:** During this period, stakers will receive **15,000,000 Weft tokens**, accounting for **75%** of the total tokens allocated for validator node staker airdrop.
- **25% of staking fees for the subsequent 6 months:** Stakers during this period will share the remaining **25%** of tokens designated for the validator node staker airdrop, totaling **5,000,000 Weft tokens**. This period concludes the airdrops to our node stakers.
- **1% staking fees after the first 12 months:** Following the initial distribution phase, the node fee rate will be set at **1%** for the foreseeable future.

## March 2024: Weft Staking on Stokenet

We invite our community to join the Weft staking test phase starting in March 2024. This test period will help validate both the concept and the technical implementation of staking on our platform.

## April 2024: Team Allocations Unlocked

In line with our initial commitments, April 10th will see th end of 6 months cliff period and the start of the 12-month linear unlocking of WEFT allocations designated for our core team members.


## End of April 2024: Weft Staking on Mainnet

By the end of April 2024, we're excited to launch staking of WEFT token on the Mainnet. This milestone is important for our project as it opens up opportunities for WEFT holders to directly contribute to the platform's stability and benefit from the profits generated on the Weft lending market for now and future application incubated by Weft. This move is our way of acknowledging and rewarding our community's dedication and active participation, ensuring they receive tangible benefits for their support.


## Q2 2024: Launch of the WEFT Foundation

We are setting up the Weft Foundation to guide the management of the WEFT token, reflecting our commitment to open and shared governance. This foundation will take care of the WEFT token, sticking to our principles of decentralization and making sure all activities within our ecosystem are fairly regulated. It's not just about overseeing; the foundation will also support and empower the project, keeping everything in line with what our community wants. This means listening to our community members and involving them in key decisions. With this approach, we aim to keep Weft innovative and true to the values it was built on, making sure our projects are well-coordinated and moving forward together.

## Q2 2024: Introducing StakeDock - Radix Projects Staking as a Service on Mainnet

Acknowledging the complexities often encountered in staking and token distribution, Weft is set to make a significant contribution to this area in June 2024. Leveraging our extensive experience, we will launch a turnkey staking platform aimed at simplifying the operation for web3 projects, both large and small. This initiative will introduce:
- An intuitive interface: Making staking accessible to everyone.
- A simple creation and configuration process: Project holders can set up their staking component in a few clicks, with options for project-specific configurations and visual customization for their and their clients' use.
- An automatic distribution system: Ensuring smooth, robust and scalable management of deposits and token redistribution among participants.

This platform aims not just to democratize access to staking but also to enrich the Radix ecosystem through increased integration and participation.

## Q3 2024: New Interface

With a continuous focus on improving user experience, Weft plans a major interface update by the third quarter of 2024. This renovation effort will primarily target our lending application, aiming to:
- Offer smoother and more intuitive navigation: Allowing every user to find what they're looking for in just a few clicks.
- Refined aesthetics: Aligned with the latest web design trends for a pleasant and modern visual experience.
- Enhanced functionalities: Providing more options and flexibility in managing loans and investments.

## Q4 2024: Transition to a DAO

Continuing our commitment to decentralized governance, the last quarter of 2024 will be marked by a strategic evolution: WEFT's transition to a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). This move will complement the role of the WEFT Foundation by integrating a participatory governance system into our ecosystem. The DAO will serve as a key instrument for certain decision-making processes, relying on proposals, voting, and the active engagement of our community.
